# Crypto Casinos in Australia

Hey there, I am Jaylee from the heart of Australia. For years I have been passionately playing in different online casinos and recently I decided to make a living out of casino affiliations. Here is what I do, I collect all the best offers and bonuses across Crypto Casinos online and offer them to the community. 

Why crypto casinos?, well mainly two reasons, first here in Australia in very hard to play in non-crypto casinos, and second, in general, the offers and bonuses in crypto casinos are a lot more generous. I regularly contact casino operators and ask for special offers that hopefully, you will find interesting. I will also post reviews of new casinos and other interesting information around the crypto casinos industry focusing on the licensing and legal aspects. All the offers, bonuses, and reviews will be only for the most trusted crypto gambling sites operators so I will recommend a few of them, and since I take very seriously my job I took the review process very carefully to provide the best value for the community.

### Winz Crypto Casino

Winz Casino is the first addition to our list, why? well, they have been the first casino I contacted and answered all the questions, and fulfilled the criteria 😂.

VIP loyalty program is available by invitation only. 

Multiple payment options. Payments are made within minutes. 

Live chat support is available 24-7.

## How do I decide what to recommend?

I look at some key factors that help me to be consistent and rigorous when evaluating and deciding what crypto gambling sites are the most appropriate to play and what offers are the most appropriated for the community.

## Crypto Casino Bonus

Crypto casinos are often held to a higher standard than regular casinos when it comes to bonuses and promotions however this is not always the case.  I look at the wager requirements, max win limits, bet size limits, deposit limits, and excluded games, as well as any hidden terms in the bonus wagering requirements that render the bonus impossible to redeem. The last thing you want to happen is using the bonus, only to find out later on that you cannot cash out all your winnings.

## Is Crypto Casino Safe?

Some players and industry experts are concerned about the safety of cryptocurrencies casinos. As with any trading, gambling, or online transactions, the best way to ensure your financial safety is to go through verified, secure, and trustworthy Crypto Casinos.

The level of anonymity offered by cryptocurrencies is not available to traditional currencies. It's balanced out by the difficulty of getting cryptocurrencies in the first place.

Even if some online gambling websites are able to navigate the tough waters of heavy regulations imposed by many countries, the Gambling Commission licenses and regulates all casinos that offer their services to gamblers, and they have the same duty of care to their players as regular land-based casinos or traditional currency online providers. 

Proper security measures and licenses are required for a site to be considered trustworthy and It is illegal for unlicensed online gambling companies to invite their customers to take part in additional gambling activity.
